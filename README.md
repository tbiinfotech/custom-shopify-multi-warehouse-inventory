# Custom Shopify Multi Warehouse Inventory App

----

- [x] Shopifyâ€™s support for multiple locations was surely helpful at creating an online space for the business. However, the default features are raw and inefficient to support a
full-fledged business. 

- [x] We have created a Shopify multi-location inventory app for merchants utilizing Shopify's multiple locations.

- [x] With our app the merchants can have complete control over all of their warehouses and the inventory levels. The app provides an easier way to track every product, variant and their quantities across all the warehouses.

- [x] Our app further makes it easier for the merchant to monitor all the products and variants that are hitting the minimum stock levels and need to be refilled immediately.
